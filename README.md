Tentative stages of the project:
1. Abstract - submitted May 2024
2. Literature Review - submitted Jun 2024
3. Initial Coding and Results - in progress
4. Final code submission - TBD
5. Presentation - TBD

Project next steps:
3.a Initial coding, data exploration and findings
  - The current code can be found within the repository
  - Initial results indicate that the previous years' corn price has a very significant positive relationship to both the planted area and overall production of the corn crop in the following year
  - Meeting coming up with advisor on Jun 27, 2024 to discuss findings, and confirm project direction
